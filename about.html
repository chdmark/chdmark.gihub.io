      	Hey everyone! My name is Chris Mark and I currently live in San Francisco, CA. I grew up in Union City, which is in the East Bay. California kid for life! I am currently going through Dev Bootcamp and aspire to be a full-stack software engineer. I went to a liberal arts college called Davidson College which is 30 minutes from Charlotte, NC. If you haven't guessed already, I went to the same school as Steph Curry! In the end, I get the best of both worlds. Go Warriors and go Wildcats! 
		</p>

      	I actually played Division I tennis for Davidson College, so you can say tennis is one of my serious hobbies. I'm super competitive when it comes to tennis, but use that drive in other aspects of my life as well! Other than that, I love playing basketball and modifying the newest gadgets. Who likes being boggled down by TouchWiz from Samsung? Let me install clean, vanilla Android on my phone! An interesting fact about me is that I actually have double jointed elbows. In addition, I enjoy listening to darker music! 
    	</p>
    	<p class="short-description">
    	Ultimately, I'd love to work for a startup in the SF Bay Area. I'd love to showcase the new skills I have acquired and grow as a software developer. Please shoot me an <a href="mailto:chdmark@gmail.com">email</a> or an InMail on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/chris-mark/47/5a2/425">LinkedIn</a> and we can get in touch!
