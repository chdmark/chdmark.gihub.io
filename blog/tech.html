      	Have you ever wondered how the Internet works? We use it in our everyday lives and it is essential to living for us now. Think about it, what would you do without the Internet? Many of us would freak out. In this blog post, I’ll explain how the Internet works on a very high level.  I’ll explain what exactly is the internet and how our data is transmitted.

     	What is exactly is the Internet? The internet is actually a computer network. It is a “collection of standalone computers” linked together to give you the information you request. The types of connections used vary from fiber-optic cables(which is where we are progressing towards), copper cables, and satellite links. Today, virtually every country in the world is connected to the Internet in some sort of shape or form.

		All files on the Internet are stored on a server. Whether it be a funny meme or a collection of pictures, it is stored somewhere on a server in the world. Files range from very little megabytes to many terabytes, but the information is processed in the same way. When you request something on the Internet like downloading a file or clicking on a link, the file gets broken down into thousands to millions of packets. The packets are routed individually throughout the Internet through devices called routers. Think of the routers as mailmen. You want to send a bunch of pieces to build a house across the country. You don’t care how they get there, but you want it in the fastest way possible. This is how routers work. The routers take each packet, read the origin, and the destination address and figure out where it needs to go next. The packets go from router to router until it reaches the destination and reassembles itself in the correct sequence. Crazy right? This all happens so fast we don’t even think about it.

		 I’m not going to get into the nitty gritty about TCP/IP and DNS in this post just yet. I wanted to provide a high level overview on how information is transmitted on the Internet. It truly is fascinating how fast information is processed and transmitted. I hope you guys learned something today and can explain to other people on how the Internet works.
