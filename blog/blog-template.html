      After watching the “Kitchen vs. Table” video, I gained a better understanding of the culture of DBC. I admit that I did not have time to watch the entire video, but I attempted to watch the portions that interested me. I did my research before applying to DBC so I had a basic understanding of what the culture of DBC. I am even more excited about the culture because DBC admits that we are part of a big experiment, and that it is not perfect. I really enjoyed Shereef’s restaurant mindset versus kitchen mindset explanation. If we come into DBC with the kitchen mindset, we’ll be able to build something special. I cannot wait to witness that personally! Culture is an extremely important part to me as my previous company had a great culture. It enhanced the whole experience for me, and my job did not seem as transactional. I’m curious to see how DBC will be a transformational experience.

       Shereef addressed one of my biggest concerns about DBC. Because I have no programming experience, I was concerned if I would be too slow. However, watching the video reassured me that DBC welcomed beginners just as long as they are willing to work hard. If we are hungry to learn and are not afraid of failure, then we will be successful. In addition, our society’s view of intelligence does not play a big factor in someone’s success at DBC. The real qualities that set someone apart are “humility, persistence, empathy, mindfulness, and integrity.” Persistence and humility resonate with me because of the work I put in to become a college tennis player. Repeatedly I witnessed “less talented” players become incredible players because of their persistence and humility. I will attempt to take this mentality into DBC, and cannot wait to struggle through the program in order to be rewarded.

      I think I would be lying if I said I was not nervous about the program. However, being nervous is not necessarily bad. In my opinion, everyone gets nervous to an extent—some more than others. If we put in the hours and focus constantly from phase 0, then I believe we will be successful throughout all phases with everyone’s support. What do you guys think?

- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I thought the experience was great! We were able to bounce ideas off each other and synthesize our ideas together. We understood that a lot of our ideas couldn't be completed without CSS knowledge. In addition, we kept each other accountable for time so we didn't go too far down the rabbit hole. 

Wireframing was definitely useful because it helped us code much faster. Since we knew where our sections wanted to be, we were able to write the code in an efficient manner. 

We decided that a good wireframe had the basic backbone of the page. We also didn't want to make it too complicated because of our limited knowledge of formatting. We kept it simple and made sure we emphasized the flow of navigation. 

I learned some new HTML5 semantic elements. In my previous challenge, we did not incorporate any HTML5 semantic elements. However, after further research, I discovered the <header>, <section>, and <footer> tags. These tags do not necessarily affect the overall look and feel of the page, but are semantic elements within HTML to help define hierarchies and sections. In HTML4, it was difficult to outline your sections with <div>. I'm still learning the differences, but I'm starting to understand the usefulness of the semantic elements!
