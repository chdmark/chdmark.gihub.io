- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I thought the experience was great! We were able to bounce ideas off each other and synthesize our ideas together. We understood that a lot of our ideas couldn't be completed without CSS knowledge. In addition, we kept each other accountable for time so we didn't go too far down the rabbit hole. 

Wireframing was definitely useful because it helped us code much faster. Since we knew where our sections wanted to be, we were able to write the code in an efficient manner. 

We decided that a good wireframe had the basic backbone of the page. We also didn't want to make it too complicated because of our limited knowledge of formatting. We kept it simple and made sure we emphasized the flow of navigation. 

I learned some new HTML5 semantic elements. In my previous challenge, we did not incorporate any HTML5 semantic elements. However, after further research, I discovered the <header>, <section>, and <footer> tags. These tags do not necessarily affect the overall look and feel of the page, but are semantic elements within HTML to help define hierarchies and sections. In HTML4, it was difficult to outline your sections with <div>. I'm still learning the differences, but I'm starting to understand the usefulness of the semantic elements!
