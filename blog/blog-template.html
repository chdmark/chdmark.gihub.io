      After watching the “Kitchen vs. Table” video, I gained a better understanding of the culture of DBC. I admit that I did not have time to watch the entire video, but I attempted to watch the portions that interested me. I did my research before applying to DBC so I had a basic understanding of what the culture of DBC. I am even more excited about the culture because DBC admits that we are part of a big experiment, and that it is not perfect. I really enjoyed Shereef’s restaurant mindset versus kitchen mindset explanation. If we come into DBC with the kitchen mindset, we’ll be able to build something special. I cannot wait to witness that personally! Culture is an extremely important part to me as my previous company had a great culture. It enhanced the whole experience for me, and my job did not seem as transactional. I’m curious to see how DBC will be a transformational experience.

       Shereef addressed one of my biggest concerns about DBC. Because I have no programming experience, I was concerned if I would be too slow. However, watching the video reassured me that DBC welcomed beginners just as long as they are willing to work hard. If we are hungry to learn and are not afraid of failure, then we will be successful. In addition, our society’s view of intelligence does not play a big factor in someone’s success at DBC. The real qualities that set someone apart are “humility, persistence, empathy, mindfulness, and integrity.” Persistence and humility resonate with me because of the work I put in to become a college tennis player. Repeatedly I witnessed “less talented” players become incredible players because of their persistence and humility. I will attempt to take this mentality into DBC, and cannot wait to struggle through the program in order to be rewarded.

      I think I would be lying if I said I was not nervous about the program. However, being nervous is not necessarily bad. In my opinion, everyone gets nervous to an extent—some more than others. If we put in the hours and focus constantly from phase 0, then I believe we will be successful throughout all phases with everyone’s support. What do you guys think?
