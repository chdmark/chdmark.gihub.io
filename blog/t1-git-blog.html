    	Wow! I embarked on my personal journey this week into the world of coding. I learned different concepts this week and was introduced to the command line. Although everything is still very introductory, it is definitely a change from what I'm used to. Anyways, enough rambling. The main focus of this blog post is to explain the benefits of version control and how git helps with version control, and reasons why you should use GitHub to store your code. Let's talk about version control first. 
    </p>
    <p>
        What exactly is version control? Version control is software that tracks changes to files throughout time so that you or people on your team can view those versions later. I know you are probably thinking I don't need to track everything if I'm working individually. Although that may be true, it would start getting messy if you were on a team of 100 working on the same project! Developers use version control to work on different projects without affecting the master project. This is beneficial because it allows people to work on a project without confusion, increases clarity of who's working on what, and you are able to revert to a previous version without bugs if something went wrong. It is important to note that Git is stored locally on your computer; it is not the same as GitHub -- which I will explain more later. Git is a type of "version control" software that helps you track those changes. 
    </p>

        It is important to understand the three different stages of how git tracks your changes: working, staging, and commit. The working stage is the directory where you are modifying your file, whether it be adding code, deleting code, etc. Most of your work is done here. The next stage is the staging area. This is the stage where you want to add your modified work, but aren't ready to fully "commit" yet. The staging area acts as a buffer zone just in case you don't want to save those changes completely. When you want to add your file to the staging area, type "git add [filename]". Make sure you don't include the brackets because I'm using it as a placeholder. What is a commit? A commit is basically permanently saving that version. After the staging area, you are ready to move to the commit stage! A commit is always accompanied by a commit message because it describes what you did to the file. As a rule of thumb, the subject of the commit line should be 50 characters or less and the body should be less than 70 characters. Use the imperative tense as well because it shows people what the commit will do instead of what you did. The command for this is commit -m "your message here". Now you are ready to push your changes to GitHub!
    </p>

        GitHub is a remote service that allows you store all of your work on the web or remotely. GitHub pulls your work from Git and stores it on their servers. You should use GitHub to store your code because it makes your code available online. This is important if you work on a team that works all over the world. With GitHub, you don't have to be right next to your colleague working on the same project. Instead, people from all over the world can work on the same project without affecting the master product. You can create "feature branches" on git and push those branches to GitHub. This helps your supervisors revise the project before merging it with the master branch. I won't get into the nitty-gritty of GitHub, but please be aware that GitHub is great for teams to collaborate efficiently and effectively.

       There you have it! I hope this post gives you a better insight of git and GitHub. I am fairly new to this, and apologize if my explanations weren't clear. I'm working on getting better and hope to see improvement in the upcoming weeks!
