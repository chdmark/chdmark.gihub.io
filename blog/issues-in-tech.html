     	Since I grew up in the heart of the Silicon Valley my entire life and spent the last year and a half working at a tech startup in Palo Alto, I am familiar with the lack of diversity problem in the Silicon Valley. Big tech companies such as Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, and Twitter released their own diversity reports to the public and it demonstrated that Hispanics, African-Americans, and women were significantly underrepresented  in this industry. A quick Google search about problems with diversity will display hundreds of articles addressing this issue, but there seems to be an ongoing problem. There is plenty of debate about what the problem is and how to fix it, but there seems to be varying opinions across the board. Since I worked in a tech startup in the Silicon Valley, let’s focus on the cultural problems within companies, and see what we can do to solve the problem. This is by no means the only problem, but talking about other issues is beyond the scope of this post.

      Since I am an Asian-American in the Silicon Valley, I in no way and shape and form feel underrepresented when I worked at my company. However, I went to college in North Carolina and was definitely a minority at my school. My school was 85% white, and 5% Asian. As you can imagine, that was quite a transition coming from my hometown here. I bring up that anecdote because I feel like I can almost empathize with minorities who do work in the tech field. I understand what they are feeling as they are just trying to “fit into” the culture. A post on NPR talks about an African-American named Angelica Coleman and how she was one of twelve black employees out of 1,200 total employees at DropBox. When interacting with her co-workers, she felt like she didn’t click with them. She asked for a promotion from an administrative position, and DropBox told her to look elsewhere for a different role. Fortunately, she now works at ZenDesk(a very reputable company).

     The problem lies in the culture of these tech companies. A report came out about women who worked in the tech industry for 7 years. 27% of those women decided to leave because they felt direct discrimination towards them. At my company alone, specifically in the sales department, 80% of my coworkers were male. If you don’t understand sales culture, I’ll tell you it can be rough as it is all about hitting your numbers and making quota. One of the biggest problems is the jokes being thrown around in companies. Men unknowingly or knowingly make derogatory jokes about women because that is the norm in this field at times. I witnessed this firsthand and it made me feel uneasy. These can make people feel uncomfortable, and prompt people to leave the company. Why work at a company where you don’t feel respected? Many smaller startups don’t have HR departments, but even companies with a massive HR department have not solved this problem. I think one of the solution lies in fixing the culture and having more informational or training sessions about best practices. Senior leadership within the company have to address these issues and help foster an environment that is welcoming of all people regardless of gender and race.  This is not an easy matter to fix, but it has to start within companies themselves, and then we can see a ripple effect among the community.
